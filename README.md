Windows has always had a way in showing every user what it is all about. In our previous tutorial, we’ve shown one of the features that will help you get even more familiar with your Windows machine through the **“System Information”** Window however, if you want to know what devices has been attached to your computer or even those that it communicated with before through a network then you will need to learn about the **“Devices and Printers”** section of the Control Panel that has been a mainstay feature in the Windows operating system for a long time now.

## Device and Printers Control Panel

Devices and Printers is simply a section that shows a list of all the devices (no matter what kind it is) which has been connected to your computer either through a wire or a wireless way. In here, you will also be able to interact with these external devices which are currently connected to your Windows machine. In short, it is an all-in-one place that displays them for you to configure or make tweaks on but the options and the interaction that you can do with each device largely depends on the drivers that are installed on your computer for it.

One important thing that you need to know about the devices that are attached to your computer is that not all have full support so the information that you will see under the Devices and Printers section would be limited for other devices. The devices that have full support would allow you to do the following from the Devices and Printers section:

* See the current status of the devices- whether it is working good or not
* View information about the device itself and share it to a network
* Change settings and make tweaks on how it works as well as use all features of the device
* Fix and troubleshoot certain problems

For devices that have full support, its icon should show up according to what the device is as you can see on the screenshot below where my Bluetooth headset really appears as it is while for devices that don’t have full support, it will just appear as a generic icon.

So now that you already have an idea on what the Devices and Printers section is all about, we’re going to try accessing it in Windows 10 as well as other in older Windows OS versions like Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 in case you are still using any of these two. Let’s start with the latest Windows version- Windows 10.
